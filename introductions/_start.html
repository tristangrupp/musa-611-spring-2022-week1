    <h2>My Interests and Experiences</h2>

    <!-- 7. Tell me briefly about your previous fields of study (undergraduate,
         graduate, or otherwise) and realms of experience (professional,
         volunteer, or otherwise). Add a paragraph element (or two) below. -->
         <p>
      Hi! I am graduated from McGill in international development. I did two years of research on tropical forests and just published a paper! 
      We found that agriculture along the Peruvian Amazon river system that did not have road access to the interior did not result in a net loss of forest over time. 
      </p><p>
      I am interested in remote sensing, food systems, agriculture, and forests. I am a city planning and urban spatial analysis dual degree.
      This semester, I am working on climate risks in artisan supply chains, Europe's forest transition, ground water abstraction for agriculture in an arid region, and exploring the Great Green Wall of the Sahel and Sahara.
      </p>
    <!-- 8. Tell me what you hope to learn in this course. Add a paragraph
         element (or two) below. -->
         <p>
          I want to learn to build web maps to make my research and work more interactive and visualized. When I show people maps and GIS work, they are often taken with how visually appealing it can be. Scrollable, zoomable, interactive maps is a superior way of displaying work compared to static maps.

          It would also be great to build a website where users can submit geographic information. It would be awesome to have a mapping platform in which users could draw polygons. I can see participatory web mapping of land tenure, land use, and environmental features. 
         </p>
